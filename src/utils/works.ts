      "The finance management application I built is a lightweight, intuitive tool designed to simplify the way contractor payments and financial records are managed. It automates manual data entry, organizes contracts and expenses, and generates real-time visual reports to support clearer decision-making. By combining responsive design and streamlined interactions, the app provides a user-friendly dashboard that makes complex financial data more accessible and actionable for users of varying technical backgrounds.",
      "I conceptualized and developed the application using Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, and Recharts to ensure a modern, scalable, and responsive experience. Although my role as an IT Analyst did not require programming, I identified a workflow bottleneck in our team’s manual processes and took the initiative to build this solution. The project strengthened my full-stack development skills and deepened my understanding of user-centered design, while significantly reducing the time spent on administrative tasks and improving operational transparency across the team.",

      "Introducing Sylvan Furniture, the ultimate destination for exquisite luxury furniture to make your home shine! Our curated collections are meticulously designed to transform living spaces into havens of sophistication. At Sylvan, we hold a steadfast commitment to customer satisfaction, understanding that every home is unique.",
      "I took on the challenge of designing and developing Sylvan Home Furniture, a full-stack ecommerce site for luxury furniture. I used various coding languages and subtle 2D animations to enhance the user experience without overcomplicating it. I used Figma to guide the design layout and typography and ensure that aesthetics and functionality worked together seamlessly. As I continued to work on it, Sylvan became a passion project, so I invested many, many hours in its development for days at a time, leading me to complete it in just 2.5 weeks, for both the design and development. Using Tailwind CSS deeply quickened the process, which made the responsiveness aspect of the project a lot less headache than if I were to use vanilla CSS or SCSS. Working with Firebase, I ensured smooth data handling and user authentication, keeping everything running effortlessly in the backend.",

      "I have used Redux for an open-source project before this project, but in this case, I was working alone with Redux, so I wanted to ensure that I truly understood and grasped how to use it effectively through watching Youtube videos and researching solutions on StackOverflow. It was the same with Stripe as well, which took some getting used to, and I ran into a lot of bugs when connecting the payment portal to my website, but after taking a step back, I was able to work through the problems with much satisfaction. I made sure to break my tasks down into checkboxes, taking every task one step at a time rather than focusing on multiple things at once. It made me stress a lot less and pay attention to the necessary details. Overall, I believe that this project conveys my design sense the best and highlights my skills as a UI designer and developer very well.",

From conceptualization to implementation, I worked diligently to ensure that every aspect of the website reflected the company's commitment to amplifying the voices of the overlooked and marginalized.

Focusing on the frontend, mainly on the design aspect of the project, allowed me to work diligently and get used to the workflow of Next.js and TypeScript without focusing too hard on the more complex aspects of the framework, and eventually, I'd grown very comfortable using Next.js and much prefer it to vanilla React because of its flexibility and overall usability.",

Lofi brings a calm, serene energy that helps to balance out mental strain, especially when going through a stressful time or being absorbed in work.

Looking back, there's definitely some things that I would change and even things that might need tweaking, but overall, I had a lot of fun coding this passion project. My main goal for this project was to master the Javascript audio library since I really wanted to create a project that had a music player for some reason. At the time that I worked on this project, I was pretty good with React, but I still felt that I needed some more practice. With what I know now, I would most likely use a backend to allow users to add their own media so that they can truly personalize their page even more. But even so, I love the site for what it is. Even now when I land on the page, I feel a sense of comfort and coziness, which is the feeling that I want to invoke from the user.",
